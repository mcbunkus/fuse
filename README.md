# FUSE

FUSE is a library that provides utility code and interface implementations that 
make it easier for sims to implement support for sim protocols (DIS, HLA, etc).
It includes rudimentary configuration handling, threading primitives such as
thread pools and channels, and some default interface implementations of 
protocols.
